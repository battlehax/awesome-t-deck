The Meshtastic documentation describes it well:

"The T-Deck is a compact device featuring a 2.8-inch IPS LCD touch screen with a resolution of 320x240 pixels, integrated with a small keyboard, trackball, microphone and speaker running on an ESP32-S3 dual-core processor. A secondary ESP32-C3 MCU is used to manage the keyboard.

T-Deck Plus variant also comes with a GPS module and a 2000 mAh battery
